            Adam S Forsythe is a British artist living and working in Bristol, UK. His practice is concerned with human narratives on the edge of society and often features ghosts, monsters, and strange cryptids. Through his work, Forsythe explores the darker and more mysterious aspects of the human experience, delving into the unknown and the unexplained. His pieces are thought-provoking and haunting, inviting viewers to question their own perceptions of reality and to consider the unseen forces that shape our world. His work has been exhibited throughout the UK and in Europe.
