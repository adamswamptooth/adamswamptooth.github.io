        <p>
             For years, I have been creating art under a pseudonym. It was a name that I invented to separate my artistic work from my professional career. However, I have come to a point where I feel that using my real name would be more appropriate for various reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I first started using a pseudonym, I had taken a long hiatus from creating art. At the time, I was working in another field and didn't want my two worlds to collide. Additionally, I was influenced by the Graf scene and the music world, where using pseudonyms is the norm. It just seemed like a natural thing to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, now I find that art has become more than just a hobby for me. It has become a significant part of my life, and I want to embrace that fully. Therefore, there's not as much worry about 'worlds colliding' anymore. I am ready to stand behind my art and my name.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, using a pseudonym can be challenging in real life situations, such as gallery openings. People who know me by my real name get confused, and it can lead to awkward situations. I want to be able to present myself as the artist that I am, without any confusion or barriers.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, I have decided to start using my real name instead of my pseudonym. I hope that this change will make it easier for people to understand my work and connect with me as an artist. I'm excited about this new chapter in my art career, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for your support throughout the years, and I look forward to continuing to create and share my art with you all under my real name.
        </p>
