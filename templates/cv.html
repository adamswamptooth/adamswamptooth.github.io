<img src="{{ static('images/portrait2.jpeg') }}" alt="A portrait of Adam Forsythe in his studio. Adam has a ginger beard, a white t-shirt and khaki pants, with a blue beanie on his head, sitting on a bench painting a painting in a green color, against a white background, with studio lighting" class="press-image" width="900" />
<p>
    Adam S. Forsythe's practice centres on an imagined landscape that sits just out of sight of the everyday world. His paintings, masks, sounds and films aren't separate projects so much as traces from that place; fragments gathered, translated and carried back. The creatures and scenes he works with feel less invented and more encountered, as if they were stumbled upon rather than designed.
</p>
<p>
    Each piece functions like an artefact from this shifting terrain, something that hints at a larger world. Forsythe's work leaves room to wander, offering viewers a sense of discovery rather than a fixed story. To live with one of his works is to hold a small part of a place that shouldn't exist but somehow does.
